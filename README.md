Personal project for using Deep Learning and Machine Learning methods to perform day trading

## Collaborators
- Quinn Graehling
- Jack Kirschler


## V1.0.0 Goals
- [ ] Data & Visualization
  - [ ] Create data loader tools that will automatically pull and create train/val/test splits from yFinance
  - [ ] Visualization tools that will allow for comprehensive visualization of any ticker pulled over varying timeframes and intervals
- [ ] Networks
  - [ ] Basic LSTM or RNN network that is capable of taking in a single ticker and produce a model for predicting said ticker
  - [ ] Extend network to handle multiple tickers to train from
  - [ ] Extensive cross ticker validation of network performance
